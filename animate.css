 <div class="about_title aniview" av-animation="bounceIn"> About Us </div>
 <div class="about_body aniview" av-animation="fadeInUp">  The energy industry is a major area for investment.  Policy makers in Jordan and elsewhere are looking closely at this sector to be the driver of future prosperity. The basic economics of energy and current developments in solar power technology are making the area of “Solar Parks” increasingly attractive. 
Ninth Circle Investment LLC is working to position itself to grow and lead this segment of the energy market.
The solar park is a concentrated zone of development of solar power generation projects and provides developers an area that is well characterized, with proper infrastructure and access to amenities and where the risk of the projects can be minimized. Solar Park will also facilitate developers by reducing the number of required approvals. Such approach will also help in the policy framework and roadmap for solar power development in Jordan. It is the first-of-its-kind in the MENA region with contiguous developed land, transmission connectivity and provision of other amenities and infrastructure. A solar power developer can get fully developed land along with transmission and other facilities and can, therefore, set up a power project without unnecessary delays
